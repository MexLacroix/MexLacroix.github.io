Air on the G String from Bach's third Orchestarl Suite was the first peice that got me into Baroque Music and Classical music as a whole was this peice by Bach. My school's orchestra played this peice and I was taken aback by how beautiful this peice was. Even though our playing was lackluster it was the first time I saw how beuatiful calssical Music was and how much of a genuis Johan Sebastian Bach was. I found myself listening to this peice on my free time and requesting it to be played during dinner. After this I listned to more bach and he became my favorite composer.

Batoven's ninth symphony is one of the most amazing and inovative peices that I have ever listened to. This was the first classical concert I got to go to and sparked in intrest in the romantic genre of music and classic. I think that this peice is amazing in many ways, but the best part is the end of the peice when the chior comes in. This peice is a wonder and psuhes the limits of what humanity can achive. The best part of this peice is that Beatoven wrote it when he was deaf!

Herbie Handcock is one of my favorite non classical composers. I love his jazz and funk works alike. My favorite has to be Hancock's Chameleon. Herbie Handcock's Chameleon got me into funk and playing the genre. I love the extermely funky bass line in this song and find myself playing this bass line on my free time for fun over and over again. After hearing this peice I started listening and playing more funk.
