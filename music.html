Batoven's ninth symphony is one of the most amazing and inovative peices that I have ever listened to. This was the first classical concert I got to go to and sparked in intrest in the romantic genre of music and classic. I think that this peice is amazing in many ways, but the best part is the end of the peice when the chior comes in. This peice is a wonder and psuhes the limits of what humanity can achive. The best part of this peice is that Beatoven wrote it when he wasa deaf!
